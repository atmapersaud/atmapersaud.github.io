<p>Competed in a Kaggle competition for a machine learning course. Built classifier to predict whether a user will click an advertisement based on several binary and high-dimensional categorical features. Dataset contained ~10 days of clickthrough data (~12 GB). A variety of approaches were attempted, including neural networks and support vector machines. For the final solution, implemented Follow The Proximally Regularized Leader (FTRL-Proximal) Algorithm, which is based on online logistic regression with L1 regularization. Final implementation in Python. Achieved top 100 (out of ~1600 teams) on leaderboard at time of submission.</p>

<p>NLP course project. Built an analogy solver for solving both multiple choice as well as open-ended analogies. Combined various methods, such as neural word embeddings via <a href="https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/" title="word2vec">word2vec</a> and explicit word via latent semantic analysis.  Incorporated semantic data from DBpedia, as well as other features such as part-of-speech tags, prefixes, and suffixes.  Evaluated system using SAT and GRE multiple choice analogy questions as well as <a href="https://word2vec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/questions-words.txt" title="Mikolov dataset">Mikolov dataset</a> of open-ended syntactic and semantic analogies. Final implementation in Python (with NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn libraries) and Java (for interfacing with DBpedia), as well as various shell scripts.</p>

<p>Implemented fast parallelized version of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for performing topic modeling on New York Times dataset <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words" title="NYT Dataset">found here</a> (300,000 documents, ~100,000,000 words in corpus). Specifically, the algorithm is called Stochastic Collapsed Variational Bayesian inference, or SCVB0. More details can be found <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Ewelling/publications/papers/fp1199-foulds.pdf" title="SCVB0 Paper">here</a>. Preliminary prototyping in MATLAB and Python using NumPy and SciPy libraries. Final implementation in C++ using OpenMP library for parallelization.</p>

<p>Explored the area of dynamic topic modeling. Applied previously-implemented LDA algorithm in this task. Used news articles from Reuters as a dataset (~162,000 articles). These articles were scraped, preprocessed, and stemmed. Using methods in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1964765" title="Topic Chains">this paper</a>, built topic chains from this dataset. Investigated the effect of using different distance metrics when building topic chains.</p>

<p>NLP homework project. Task was to perform homophone correction
for the following pairs of homophones in a text: </p>

<pre><code>it's vs its
you're vs your
they're vs their
loose vs lose
to vs too
</code></pre>

<p>My solution was to use n-gram language modeling of the part-of-speech tags. More details about the solution can be found at the link below. Used Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia data as well as Brown corpus containing
a variety of document types. Implemented in Python using NLTK library.</p>
